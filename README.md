# MLlabvut

This repository contains a branch for each lab session related to the Machine Learning lab (ML). Each branch is dedicated to a specific lab assignment, facilitating organized development and submission of the code and materials for each lab. By utilizing branches, I can work on different labs simultaneously without interfering with the main codebase. Each branch represents a distinct stage in the learning process, providing a clear overview of the work completed for each lab assignment. Thank you for taking note of this information.
